                                                   == GAME UI PROGRESS ==
Currently the main method file should control and call all the ui classes, which should in return call and control all the business class classes. 

GameUI is 90% complete for our first pass, it just needs the game grid and the logic for the grid. 

++UPDATES++
  -game grid logic added
  -grid visuals added
  
++TO-DO++
  -move all of the gameboard grid gui functions into their own method so they can be seperately redrawn with the ui update method.

****Needed methods from game and gameboard****

A get method for score. It should be passed a boolean or int for black or white user and return the int number for that player's score.

A get method of player's name, it should pass a boolean or int for black or white user and return that user's name as a string.
